# MiniDrive App

## Problem Statement

*As of late, your usually high-performance computer has been acting rather sluggish.*
*You come to realize that while you have plenty of free disk space on your machine,*
*it is split up over many hard drives.*
*You decide that the secret to improving performance is to consolidate all the data on your computer onto as few hard drives as possible.*
*Given a Integer() used, representing the amount of disk space used on each drive,*
*and a corresponding Integer() total , representing the total capacity of each drive mentioned in used,*
*you should attempt to pack the data onto as few hard drives as possible.*
*You may assume that the data consists of very small files, such that splitting it up and moving parts of it onto different hard drives never presents a problem.*
*Return the minimum number of hard drives that still contain data after the consolidation is complete.*

A small WPF application that will help solving the above stated case.
